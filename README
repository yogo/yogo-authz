=== DESCRIPTION

== INSTALL
Introduction goes here.
This plugin/engine requires the following gems to be installed:

* authlogic -- http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master

=== DataMapper Plugins

* dm-core
* dm-validations
* dm-timestamps
* dm-validations
* awesome_nested_set -- http://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set/tree/master

While Yogo uses Perseverse to store scientific data, this plugin stores it's information 
in a relational database.

A database with the identify of users needs to be configured in the database.yml file.

eg.
users:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3

config/initializers/datamapper.rb need to be updated to load this configuration. This can by adding
this line the the config file:

DataMapper.setup(:users, config['users'])


== RESOURCES

== TODO
* Make Authlogic work with DataMapper
