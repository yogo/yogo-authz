= YogoAuthz - An Authentication and Authorization component of the Yogo Data Management Toolkit
=== DESCRIPTION

This a component of the Yogo Data Management Toolkit. It has been developed as a rails engine to keep 
the implementation optional and separate from data management components. It provides authentication
with the help of Authlogic, and authorization. Default controller, models, and views are provided
with this component, but all may be overwritten in a Rails app.

The goals of this component are to provide a fleiable and customizable authentication and 
authorization system that is implemented separately from the main app. A minimal number of changes
to a rails app are needed to fully utilize YogoAuthz.

== INSTALL
Introduction goes here.
This plugin/engine requires the following gems to be installed:

=== Required Gems
* authlogic -- http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master
* dm-core
* dm-validations
* dm-timestamps
* dm-validations
* dm_is_nested-set

This component provides controllers, views, and models


To use this component

A rake task is provided to create the tables in the database and create a sysadmin user and password.

rake yogo_authz:load_default_info

Include YogoAuthz::AuthenticatedSystem and YogoAuthz::AuthorizationSystem in the application_controller.rb

For every controller you want protected, add
require_authorization


All components of this can be overwritten in the main app. That is just the way Ruby works.
